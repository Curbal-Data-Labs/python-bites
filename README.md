#  A collection of python bites

To learn Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, we are going to build a Crime Mystery Game. '

To solve the game, we will need to use data, and that is how numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries come into play.

Every week, I will go through the theory needed to build it and leave it up to you to put it together or finalize the build.
